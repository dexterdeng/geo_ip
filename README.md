# GeoIp

This version support the newest API on ipinfodb.com.

---- the V3 API, and use the newest database;

Retreive the geolocation of an IP address based on the [ipinfodb.com](http://ipinfodb.com/) webservice.

As of 8th November 2010, the service is asking that all users [register](http://ipinfodb.com/register.php) for an API key.

Consider making a donation to [ipinfodb.com](http://ipinfodb.com/) at [http://ipinfodb.com/donate.php](http://ipinfodb.com/donate.php).

## Usage

### Set API key
    GeoIp.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

This must be done before making the geolocation call.

### Retrieve geolocation
    GeoIp.geolocation(ip_address)

### Example

    # 209.85.227.104 = google.be (US)
    GeoIp.geolocation('209.85.227.104')

returns:

    {
      :status           =>"OK",
      :ip               =>"209.85.227.104"
      :country_code     =>"US",
      :country_name     =>"United States",
      :region_code      =>"06",
      :region_name      =>"California",
      :city             =>"Mountain View",
      :zip_postal_code  =>"94043",
      :latitude         =>"37.4192",
      :longitude        =>"-122.057"
    }

### Country only

There is an option to only retreive the country information and thus excluding the city details. This results in a faster response from the service since less queries need to be done.

    GeoIp.geolocation('209.85.227.104', {:precision => :country})

returns:

    {
      :status           => "OK",
      :ip               => "209.85.227.104"
      :country_code     => "US",
      :country_name     => "United States"
    }

### Timezone information

There is an option now to retrieve optional timezone information too:

  GeoIp.geolocation('209.85.227.104', {:timezone => true})

returns:

    {
      :status           =>"OK",
      :ip               =>"209.85.227.104"
      :country_code     =>"US",
      :country_name     =>"United States",
      :region_code      =>"06",
      :region_name      =>"California",
      :city             =>"Mountain View",
      :zip_postal_code  =>"94043",
      :latitude         =>"37.4192",
      :longitude        =>"-122.057"
      :timezone_name    =>"America/Los_Angeles",
      :utc_offset       =>-25200,
      :dst?             =>true
    }

Obviously it is not possible to have the country precision enabled while retrieving the timezone information.

### Timeout

It is possible to set a timeout for all requests. By default it is one second, but you can easily set a different value. Just like you would set the api_key you can set the timeout:

    GeoIp.timeout = 5 # In order to set it to five seconds

## Getting it

GeoIp can be installed as a Ruby Gem:

    gem install geo_ip

### Rails

#### Bundler enabled (Rails 3.0.x and 2.3.x)

In your Gemfile:

    gem 'geo_ip', '~> 0.3.0'

Then create an initializer `config/initializers/geo_ip` (or name it whatever you want):

    GeoIp.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

#### Pre-bundler (Rails 2.3.x or older)

In your `config/environment.rb`:

    config.gem 'geo_ip', :version => '~> 0.3.0'

Then create an initializer `config/initializers/geo_ip` (or name it whatever you want):

    GeoIp.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

## Testing

Set up your API key first for the test suite by creating a spec/api.yml file. Follow the example in spec/api.yml.example. Then run the tests with:

    ruby spec/geo_ip_spec.rb

If you get a LoadError, you should run the tests with:

    ruby -rubygems spec/geo_ip_spec.rb
